Build a new automation process that consolidates data from multiple Excel reports into one and creates a pivot table and chart.

Streamline the process by integrating data from multiple reports and creating a single dashboard view.

Timely reporting allowing the Sales team to take decisions based on real time data.

Improved data quality (automation will allow validation of the data from the coffee shops before it's merged and processed).

If the number of shops increases, automation can be scalable to handle more data.

Reduced manual effort.

Risk mitigation (automating the process will reduce errors that could happen when copying and pasting the data manually).
